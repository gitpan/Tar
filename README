This is the README file for Archive::Tar, the Perl module for creation
and manipulation of tar files.

This is version 0.06. For changes since previous versions, see the POD
documentation in the Tar.pm file.

This module uses no C-coded parts in itself, but it will try to use
the Compress::Zlib module to read and write gzipped tarfiles.
Archive::Tar will still work without Zlib, it will just complain a
little bit (and, of course, not be able to use compression). The
complaining will be removed when the module leaves the alpha stage,
and can be trivially removed by commenting out the offending print
near the top of Tar.pm.

If you use this module at all, please mail me (calle@lysator.liu.se)
and tell me what you think of it.
